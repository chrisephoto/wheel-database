# Wheel Database

I created this to serve as a searchable database of Japanese brand wheels - especially those less known, including photos and specifications of each wheel. This was heavily inspired by the work done at [Kyusha Shoes](https://www.kyushashoes.com).

I do not claim this database to be complete or comprehensive but I do intend to make sure all of the data is as accurate as possible. Most of this data has been gathered from archives of the manufacturers websites and books such as Holiday Auto, Gold Car Top, and HyperRev.

If you find this resource helpful and would like to support this project feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://paypal.me/chrisephoto).

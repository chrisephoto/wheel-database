# Wheel Database

I created this page to serve as a searchable database of (primarily) Japanese made wheels, including photos and specifications of each wheel. This was heavily inspired by the work Quentin has done at [Kyusha Shoes](https://www.kyushashoes.com).

There is still quite a bit of work to do to before the database can be fully populated. Things left to do include:
* CSS: Finish layout and design of Wheel Detail modal
* JS: Finialize database JSON format, object keys and values
* JS: Auto-populate filter options based on database contents
* JS: Implement filtering of displayed wheels

Once all of the HTML/CSS/JS is functional I will begin updating the database.js file with wheels. Everything has been designed with a goal of making updating the site/database easy and straight forward.

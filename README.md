# Wheel Database

I created this page to serve as a searchable database of Japanese made wheels - especially those less known, including photos and specifications of each wheel. This was heavily inspired by the work done at [Kyusha Shoes](https://www.kyushashoes.com).

If you find this resource helpful and would like to support this project feel free to [buy me a coffee](https://paypal.me/chrisephoto).
